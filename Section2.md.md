## Section 2 - Registering Donors or Sources, Organs, and Samples
**NOTE:** We strongly recommend that you collect donor or source information when you get the organ and sample, well before you begin actual preparations to submit data.

|Step | Comments |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Register a donor or source | Register a donor via <a href="http://ingest.hubmapconsortium.org">HuBMAP ingest portal</a>. <br> &nbsp; • A <em>donor</em> in HuBMAP is an individual from which organs and samples originate. <br> Register a source via <a href="https://data.sennetconsortium.org/search">SenNet Data Sharing Portal</a>. <br> &nbsp; • A <em>source</em> in SenNet is the organism being studied.|
|&nbsp; a. Search for the donor <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or source:| Verify that the donor or source has not already been registered.|
|&nbsp; b. From the Navigation bar: | &nbsp; •  In HuBMAP select: REGISTER NEW > INDIVIDUAL > Donor <br> &nbsp; •  In SenNet select: Create an Entity > Source|
|&nbsp; c. Record donor or source <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; information: | Do <em>NOT</em> include <a href="https://ingest.hubmapconsortium.org/new/donor">protected health information</a> about a donor or source, organ, or specimen.|
|&nbsp; d. Complete registration: | &nbsp; •  In HuBMAP click <b>Generate ID</b> to complete the registration process. <br> &nbsp; •  In SenNet click <b>Submit</b> to complete the registration process.|

**IMPORTANT** _Prerequisite:_ Before registering a sample or organ, the associated donor or source _must_ be registered. You also need the ID of the organ and the DOI (from <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a>) for the case selection protocol.

|2. Register an organ or sample | In addition to _organ_ there are 3 sample types: _Block, Section,_ and _Suspension._|
|&nbsp; a. From the Navigation bar: | In HuBMAP select: <br> &nbsp; • REGISTER NEW > INDIVIDUAL > Sample; (used for both organs and samples). <br> &nbsp; • For organs - Select **Organ** from the _Tissue Sample Type_ drop down <br> &nbsp; • For samples - Select **Block, Section,** or **Suspension** from the _Tissue Sample Type_ drop down <br> In SenNet select: <br> &nbsp; • Create an Entity > Sample; (used for both organs and samples). <br> &nbsp; • Select the appropriate field from the _Sample Category_ drop-down: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ Select from **block, section, suspension, bodily fluid, organ,** or **organ piece**. <br> &nbsp; • If <strong>organ</strong> is selected, select the <em>organ type</em> from the dropdown list.|
|&nbsp; b. Record sample information | In HuBMAP, the _Source ID_ field represents the organ or sample’s parent, the donor. <br>In SenNet, the _Ancestor ID_ field represents the organ or sample’s source. |
|&nbsp; c. Is the sample a tissue block? | Upload a thumbnail image: <br> &nbsp; • A stained microscopy image of a tissue section that represents the tissue block. <br> &nbsp; • Label the image using this format: _[block_submission_id].[jpg]_. <br> &nbsp; • Preferably, **800** x **600** pixels, in JPEG or PNG format. <br> See also: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swtxxF9z8Llnptqk4eNvgDpYUwDrViI78KbRI3b1jXg/edit#heading=h.cd53uti4az4">Images SOP. </a>|
|&nbsp; d. 3D reference object? | IF a 3D reference objects exits for the organ... <br> &nbsp; • It is part of the <em>Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)</em>, which refers to the entire body. <br> &nbsp; • See the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-3d-reference-library.html"> CCF Portal </a> for a listing of supported organs.|
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes — click **Register Location** <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No — (no existing CCF)| To register the sample in CCF Coordinate space. <br> &nbsp; • See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=142hGer4xvU"> video </a> or download the SOP <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5575776">here</a>. <br> &nbsp; • Contact <a href="infoccf@indiana.edu"> MC-IU </a> if the organ or tissue you are imaging is <em>not</em> represented in the CCF.|
|&nbsp; e. Complete registration | &nbsp; • In HuBMAP click **Generate ID** to complete the registration process. <br> &nbsp; • In SenNet click **Submit** to complete the registration process. <br> &nbsp; • After an organ or sample is registered, the system will confirm the process. <br> &nbsp; • The system will also assign an ID for the item.|
