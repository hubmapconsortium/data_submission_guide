# data_submission_guide
A documentation site for the Data Submission Guide used by both HuBMAP and SenNet
This site is experimental at this phase **11/15/2023**.

Update **12/14/2023** - The draft version has been released to key stakeholders for review.
- **dev** branch created from **main** (exact copy of **main**)
- removed all unneeded files in **main**; these files will be retained in the **dev** branch for archival purposes

The Markdown (MD) files in this repo consist of sections in the Data Submission Guide (DSG), a resource for data submitters in the HuBMAP and SenNet Consortia.
The files are pulled into a WordPress page (via a plugin) and display as a webpage on the HuBMAP Consortium website. This process was tested for the HuBMAP Consortium. 
This process can be used by the SenNet consortium to make this content availble for their members.

Updating and maintaining this content is simply a matter of updating the relevant MD file(s) as changes are needed.
