<h3 id="Create-New-Protocol">Creating an entirely new protocol (from "scratch"):</h3>

1. Log into protocols.io Using your protocols.io login registered with your consortium.
2. Select your Workspace:
   - Click the HuBMAP icon for the HuBMAP Workspace
   - Click the SenNet icon for the SenNet Workspace
   - If you do not see your icon you have not been added to the group - Contact your helpdesk for assistance.
3. Click the **NEW +** button at the top and select **New protocol**.
4. Select a template option:
   - There are several template options for a protocol.
   - The option selected determines the tool widgets shown on the right.
5. Rename the protocol from “untitled protocol” to something more descriptive so the protocol saves properly.
6. A series of tabs displays under the protocol title: (_Description, Guidelines..., Materials, etc._)
   - Fill in information for all tabs shown
   - Under _Description > Keywords_ enter your consortium and group (TMC, etc.)
7. Publishing - When you are satisfied that the protocol is complete...
   - Select **MORE > Publish**
   - Publishing is a multistep process (see below).

**IMPORTANT:** Once published, a protocol cannot be deleted or edited, only versioned.

### Publishing your new protocol:

1. Publish type - select **With DOI**. <br> **IMPORTANT:** HuBMAP and SenNet protocols MUST be assigned a DOI.
    - This is required to register a donor (or source) and samples.
    - This is required to submit assay metadata to the HIVE or CODCC.
2. Set authors - Multiple authors may be added in order of importance.
   - You can drag-and-drop authors to reorder.
3. Status - Select _Working, In Development,_ or _Other_.
4. Research study - Select _Research_ (most likely) or _Non-Research_.
5. Add workspaces - _Show_ and _Share_ the protocol on the HuBMAP (or SenNet) Workspace.
   - You can also show or share the protocol on any other workspace, if desired.
6. Publish - Publish the protocol.
