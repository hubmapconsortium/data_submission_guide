## Section 6 - Preparing Metadata Files

Click the provided links in this section to access additional relevant information or resources.

Create metadata files. Download and complete the latest version of each required metadata template:
  - assay-specific
  - <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/contributors/current/">contributors</a>
  - <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/antibodies/">antibodies</a> (if relevant) 
  
  Lists of assay-specific templates are available from the HuBMAP consortium’s <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/">Data Upload Guidelines</a> page.
  
  **Note:** Many HuBMAP metadata schemas are shared by SenNet. The <a href="https://docs.sennetconsortium.org/libraries/ingest-validation-tools/schemas/source-murine">murine source schema</a> is _unique_ to SenNet.

1. Assay-specific templates. Clicking on an assay type (on the page linked above) takes you to a page for that type.
   - Select the <strong>Excel template</strong> on that page.
   - Each page includes field name descriptors, format requirements.
2. The <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/contributors/current/">Contributors template</a> lists the names, institutions, and ORCID ID's of contributors to the dataset.
   - If ALL datasets listed in your assay metadata use the same set of contributors, you may submit just one contributors file.
   - Point to the file in the <em>contributors_path</em> field for the corresponding datasets.
3. <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/antibodies/"> Antibodies template</a>. Required for all assays that use antibodies.
   - If _ALL_ datasets in your assay metadata use the same set of antibodies:
   - You may submit just one <em>antibodies</em> file.
     
**NOTE:** A separate antibody _validation report_ is also required.

|If datasets in the submission use | |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; • Different sets of <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; antibodies <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; — OR —  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Same set, different lots | Each unique antibody set must be listed in a separate _antibody.tsv_ with a unique name <br> &nbsp; • (e.g., dataset<font color=red>1</font>_antibodies.tsv, dataset<font color=red>2</font>_antibodies.tsv, etc). <br> &nbsp; • Different lot numbers for different datasets.|
|&nbsp; &nbsp; • Custom antibodies | Indicate the batch date (_format: yyyy-mm-dd_) in the lot_number field. |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; • Assay-specific channel_id | The _channel_id_ field in the antibodies TSV is populated with assay-specific <br> information in the following formats: |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ CODEX: cycle#_CH# | The cycle/channel information is generated by the <em>Akoya</em> instrument used for CODEX. |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ Cell DIVE: cycle#_CH# | The following 3 assays do not involve cycles: |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ ‣ Light sheet: | &nbsp; &nbsp; _channel_id_ is the name of the _fluorophore_ tag on the antibody. |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ ‣ MIBI: | &nbsp; &nbsp; _channel_id_ is the name of the _metal_ tag on the antibody. |
|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‣ ‣ IMC: | &nbsp; &nbsp; _channel_id_ is the name of the _metal_ tag on the antibody. |
|Check for RRID registration | If an RRID (Research Resource Identifier) has _not_ been assigned for an antibody, <br> <a href="http://antibodyregistry.org">register the antibody</a>. |
