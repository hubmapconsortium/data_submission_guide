## Section 11 - Data Review

**Final Review, Data Approval, and Publication** <br>
This section sets the stage for publication of your data. Once your data is reviewed and passes all validation it can be published and made available to the scientific community.
**NOTE:** For data processed using a HIVE / CODCC pipeline, the pipeline must complete without throwing a programmatic error prior to the final data review.
