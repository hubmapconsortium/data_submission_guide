## Section 12 - dbGap Submission

After the registration of a dbGaP study by a data provider, the submission of data to that dbGaP study is a joint process undertaken by both the data provider and the HIVE or CODCC. We encourage data providers to create a dbGaP study and notify the HIVE or CODCC as early as possible. 

**NOTE:** The dbGaP submission process can take up to six months after the publication of your sequence data in the HuBMAP Data portal or SenNet Data Sharing portal. 

1. **Identify an NIH GPA:** The Data Provider PI works with their Program Officer to identify an NIH Genomic Program Administrator (GPA) who will help them prepare a study for dbGaP following the [process outlined here](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/submitting-genomic-data/how-to-register-and-submit-a-study-in-dbgap). 
2. **Register dbGaP study / create Bioproject:** The Data Provider PI and NIH GPA register a study in the [dbGaP Submission System](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/ss/dbgapss.cgi?login) and create a Bioproject for the study. This step should be done by the data provider as early as possible, ideally before any data are generated. 
3. **Data Provider PI / PM contact the HIVE / CODCC:** The Data Provider PI or project manager (PM) should contact the HIVE as soon as a dbGaP study has been registered, to initiate HIVE (or CODCC) involvement in the process. 
4. The Data Provider PI or PM identify a team member to serve as the designated data submitter.
5. The designated data submitter contacts the HIVE through the HuBMAP help desk. 
6. The HIVE will identify a HIVE data submitter to work with the team member on the dbGap data submission. 
7. The Data Provider PI adds the designated data submitter and the HIVE data submitter as submitters for the dbGaP study on the NCBI dbGaP submission portal. NOTE: This is distinct from the dbGaP Submission system identified in step 2, above. 
8. The Data Provider PI or their designated data submitter completes the Submission Portal Questionnaire on the NCBI dbGaP submission portal for the registered study (step 2, above). 
9. Following the dbGaP instructions, the designated data submitter and the HIVE data submitter download the dbGaP Submission Guide Templates and work together to complete the forms required for submission. Gather and complete ALL files BEFORE submitting. 
These forms will include at least the following for HuBMAP projects: 
    - Study Config (Completed by designated data submitter)
    - Subject Consent DS and DD (Completed by the HIVE data submitter)
    - Subject Sample Mapping (SSM) DS and DD (Completed by the HIVE data submitter)
    - Sample Attributes DS and DD (Completed by the HIVE data submitter) 
    **NOTE:** DS = Dataset, DD = Data Dictionary 

Depending on the answers provided to the Submission Portal Questionnaire, the designated data submitter may also need to complete the following files for upload: 
  - Mapping Study Samples to Other NCBI databases (e.g. Sample GEO Mapping DS and DD)
  - Subject Phenotypes DS and DD
  - Pedigree DS and DD
  - Study Documents (consent forms, protocols, etc.) 
    
10. The HIVE data submitter reviews this checklist to ensure that the Phenotype Datasets and Data dictionary files will pass the dbGaP quality control tests. 
11. The HIVE data submitter submits all of the required forms above, all at once, in one submission. 12. A dbGaP phenotype curator contacts the submitters once the above information has been loaded into dbGaP and entities have received NCBI BioSample and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) IDs. 
13. The HIVE data submitter follows the instructions here and here to upload sequencing metadata and submit the raw sequence reads in collaboration with an SRA curator, to a protected area of SRA. 
14. SRA processes the sequence data and metadata and notifies dbGaP and the submitters. 
15. The human sequence data will be distributed through Authorized Access upon dbGaP release of the study. IMPORTANT: This process can take an additional 6-8 weeks.
